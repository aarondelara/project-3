# Money Man

# Story
 Finacial organizaion is a great skill to have especially when you want to know where all your money is going. This idea gave us the plan of why we should keep track of it. This lead us to create our app Money Man. This helps people when they sign up manage all the bills they have for the month which will give insight on how much they need by the end of the month.This also gives you the idea of how much you have left for saving or spending on small convenience that you need. But on the technical side of things we got to see what it takes to connect the front and back end of a website. To have a seamless connectivity between the two.
